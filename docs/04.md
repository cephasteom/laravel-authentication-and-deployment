## Learning Objectives
- Understand how an API checks your credentials
- Be able to setup Laravel Passport to handle request authorisation
- Update your API to authorise chosen routes

## Key Language

## Authorisation
APIs typically use tokens to authenticate users. The process is as follows:
- The user makes a request to a dedicated authorisation endpoint, providing a username and a password
- The API checks whether these credentials exist in the database
- If valid, send back a token unique to your user
- The user makes all future requests supplying the token in the header
- The API accepts the request, checks the validity of the token and brings up the user's data if valid
- The API is able to grant or deny requests based on whether the user is valid and who the user is

Install Laravel Passport
````
composer require laravel/passport
````

Create database tables to store access tokens in (vagrant ssh)
````
artisan migrate
````

Install Laravel Passport
````
artisan passport:install
````

Make a note of the password grant Client ID and Client Secret that get printed out following successful installation. Something like:
````
...
Password grant client created successfully.
Client ID: 2
Client secret: QtE4syo8QFwvw4bMEK5Ej2zaJ3jgF3RYmF1JjZmU
````


In AuthServiceProvider.php use the Passport class to add necessary routes to your app  
````
use Laravel\Passport\Passport;
...
class AuthServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
	...
	public function boot()
    {
    	...
    	Passport::routes();
    }
}
````

Finally, in config/auth.php config file, set the driver of the api authentication guard to 'passport'  
````
'guards' => [
    ...

    'api' => [
        'driver' => 'passport',
        'provider' => 'users',
    ],
],
````


Create single user on the command line...
````
artisan tinker
App\User::create(array('name' => 'admin', 'email' => 'admin@admin.com', 'password' => Hash::make('password')));
````

You should now be able to make a request in Postman to POST `http://homestead.test/oauth/token` with the body:  
````
{
	"grant_type": "password"
	"client_id": "2",
	"client_secret": "OTXeJFxNTHLDuMnsHgu5pAmpnMv1YMM98AY4oyM4",
	"username": "admin@admin.com",
	"password": "password"
}
````
If everything is setup correctly, the token that gets returned can be stored then sent as a Bearer Token with each following request.
